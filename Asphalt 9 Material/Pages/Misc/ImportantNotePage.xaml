                        if you have the informations then fill them according to what you have (you don't need to fill every single field of these two sections just as <LineBreak /><LineBreak />much as you have).

                         fill them as much as you have if you don't then leave the field or fields empty, these fields doesn't support dots or points you have to write real<LineBreak /><LineBreak /> numbers like 45000.

                        you have to write real numbers (no points or dots) every cost field in Additional Parts Section is for a single part like most of B class cars are required 8 
                        <LineBreak /><LineBreak />epics which 2 for each top speed, handling, acceleration, nitro, the cost field is for 1 epic of those 8                         
                        epics, so that if you add a car that required total 8 epics you write the cost for 1/8 of those epics.
