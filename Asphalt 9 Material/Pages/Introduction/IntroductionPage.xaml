For this race mode, the player has to successfully do stunts without hitting the cars at the end (not doing so will cause you to hit the cops' barricade) to win the race. Any wreck instantly results in disqualification. In future updates, the player will no longer get busted upon any wrecks (unless running out of time or hitting the barricades at the end of the track).

                        "Tuning" a car is required to get your car to higher stats. This game encourages upgrading more than games such as Asphalt 8. You can star up cars to unlock more upgrades by collecting blueprints for the car. As you star up your car, the upgrades progressively increase in price.

                        All cars in the game allow you to upgrade cars with blueprints called "Import parts." Every car has a base price for upgrading with these parts, and regardless of how many you have already used, they do not change price as you go on. The 3 different import parts are as follows:

                        : import parts are parts that are class specific. There are still 4 different parts that you recieve, but they do vary between the different classes. Some parts are only used for Class C, while others are only used for Class B. Obviously, you cannot apply a rare import onto a car that isn’t in the respective class. These are a bit more expensive than the uncommon import parts.

Some cars in the game, especially cars that are high in their class, or are high in class (i.e. Lamborghini Centenario, Ford GT, Pininfarina H2 Speed, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Porsche 918, etc.) are cars that commonly require these parts to level up. They are mostly found within specific packs, such as event packs, and are needed only when your car is high in stars.
